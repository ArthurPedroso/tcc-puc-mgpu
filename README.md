# tcc-puc - Multi-GPU Rendering Exploration using Vulkan (Undergraduate Thesis)

This project represents the culmination of my undergraduate studies, serving as my thesis exploring multi-GPU rendering techniques employing Vulkan.

This project investigates the feasibility of implementing hardware-agnostic multi-GPU rendering systems. The primary goal is to analyze and extend an existing solution, utilizing Vulkan, for multi-GPU rendering.

## Objectives
- Investigate and evaluate existing techniques for multi-GPU rendering.
- Analyze, enhance, and extend an established multi-GPU framework employing Vulkan.
- Aim for hardware-agnostic approaches that transcend specific GPU configurations or proprietary technologies.

## Key Contributions
- Comprehensive exploration of prevalent multi-GPU rendering techniques.
- Analysis and augmentation of an established multi-GPU framework, specifically utilizing Vulkan.
- Emphasis on promoting interoperability across diverse GPU configurations without reliance on proprietary technology.
